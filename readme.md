#  Recreational Complex Management System

## Bronco Recreation complex wants to develop a Bronco Recreation complex management system 
(BRCM) for the computerization of the customer visits, activities, billing, and their services to 
ensure effective control, improved efficiency and reduce their operational costs. This system will 
replace their current maintenance of all the above-mentioned items by hand.

The purpose of this project is to develop a computerized system that can be used by customers to 
make reservations and to look at their previous history of their visits to the complex. The 
complex staff can use the system to manage recreational activities, users, order booking, price 
management including discounts, and to generate business intelligence.

Project was developed using Java in IntelliJ IDEA. Two components were created. One for 
desktop use and one for web use. We used plain html, css, javascript to develop a user-friendly 
interface for the website component. Java FX was used to develop Desktop applications. Java 
Springboot for the server/backend. For the central database, we used PostgreSQL and Hibernate 
as ORM for the database.
